POINTING SYSTEM WITH CHECKOUT

1. In the case of a user having a point, the app will have to 1st check the amount that 1,000,000 will equals (e.g if 1M points = 10$)

2. And then this will then be minused if choosen from the current balance of the total
checkout amount in USD.

{ NB: Assume a user has 1M points in their balance, -
choosing to offset this balance with their points will take the }

3. Then there will be a contract which will collect this amount and not the already deployed
contract that is supposed to receive the original product sale, just for the sake of keeping track
